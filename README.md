## **Mirror Clone**

I learnt to develop a Clone of Mirror.xyz using [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) as the storage layer and [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as the smart contract protocol.  

[Mirror](mirror.xyz) is a powerful blog publishing platform native to Web 3. It allows authors to own their posts and leverage the economic rails of crypto to earn value from readers.
